## Sentence Alignment using Siamese Deep Network

Sentence alignment is an area of research in Natural Language Processing (NLP) which has application in Machine Translation, Summarization, Simplification, etc. The goal in sentence alignment is to find mappings between sentences across parallel texts. This mapping is not necessary a one-to-one mapping between sentences of two parallel texts. 

In this project, we use a Siamese Deep Network to do sentence alignment. Previously we used traditional NLP methods to do sentence alignment across monolingual parallel texts.
